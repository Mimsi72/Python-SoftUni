Problems for in-class lab for the Python Advanced Course @SoftUni. Submit your solutions in the SoftUni judge system at https://judge.softuni.bg/Contests/1836
1.	ASCII Values
Write program that receives a list of characters and creates a dictionary with each character as a key and
 nits ASCII value as a value. Try solving that problem using comprehensions.
Examples
Input	Output
a, b, c, a	{'a': 97, 'b': 98, 'c': 99}
d, c, m, h	{'d': 100, 'c': 99, 'm': 109, 'h': 104}
2.	No Vowels
Using a comprehension write a program that receives a text and removes all the vowels from it, case insensitive. Print the new text string after removing the vowels. The vowels that should be considered are 'a', 'o', 'u', 'e', 'i'.
Examples
Input	Output
Python	Pythn
ILovePython	LvPythn
3.	Even Matrix
Write a program that receives a matrix of numbers and prints a new one only with the numbers that are even. Use nested comprehension for that problem.
Examples
Input	Output
2
1, 2, 3
4, 5, 6	[[2], [4, 6]]
4
10, 33, 24, 5, 1
67, 34, 11, 110, 3
4, 12, 33, 63, 21
557, 45, 23, 55, 67	[[10, 24], [34, 110], [4, 12], []]
4.	Flattening Matrix
Write a program that receives a matrix and prints the flattened version of it (a list with all the values). For example, the flattened list of the matrix: [[1, 2], [3, 4]] will be [1, 2, 3, 4].

Examples
Input	Output
2
1, 2, 3
4, 5, 6	[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
3
10, 2, 21, 4
5, 20, 41, 9
6, 2, 4, 99	[10, 2, 21, 4, 5, 20, 41, 9, 6, 2, 4, 99]
5.	Filter Numbers
You will be given a start and an end. Print all the numbers in the given range (inclusive) that are divisible by any of the numbers from 2 to 10. Use comprehensions for this problem.
Examples
Input	Output
1
20	[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15, 16, 18, 20]
45
50	[45, 46, 48, 49, 50]
