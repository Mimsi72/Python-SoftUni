Lab: Multidimensional Lists


1.	Sum Matrix Elements
Write a program that reads a matrix from the console and prints:
•	The sum of all matrix elements
•	The matrix itself
On the first line, you will receive the matrix sizes in format "{rows}, {columns}". On the next rows, you will get elements for each column separated with a ", ".
Examples
Input	Output
3, 6
7, 1, 3, 3, 2, 1
1, 3, 9, 8, 5, 6
4, 6, 7, 9, 1, 0
	76
[[7, 1, 3, 3, 2, 1], [1, 3, 9, 8, 5, 6], [4, 6, 7, 9, 1, 0]]
2.	Sum Matrix Columns
Write a program that reads a matrix from the console and prints the sum for each column on separate lines. On the first line,
you will get matrix sizes in format "{rows}, {columns}". On the next rows, you will get elements for each column separated with
a single space.
Examples
Input	Output
3, 6
7 1 3 3 2 1
1 3 9 8 5 6
4 6 7 9 1 0

18

Hints
•	Read matrix sizes.
•	On the next row lines, read the columns.
•	Traverse the matrix and sum all elements in each column.
•	Print the sum and continue with the other columns.
3.	Primary Diagonal
Write a program that finds the sum of matrix primary diagonal. On the first line, you will receive
an integer N – the size of the square matrix. The next N lines holds the values for every row – N
numbers, separated by a single space

Examples
Input
3
11 2 4
4 5 6
10 8 -12

Output
4

3
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9

15

4.	Symbol in Matrix
Write a program that reads a number - N, representing the rows and columns of a matrix. On the next N lines, you will receive rows of the matrix. Each row consists of ASCII characters. After that, you will receive a symbol. Find the first occurrence of that symbol in the matrix and print its position in the format: "({row}, {col})". You should start searching from the top left. If there is no such symbol print an error message "{symbol} does not occur in the matrix"
Examples
Input	Output
3
ABC
DEF
X!@
!
(2, 1)

4
asdd
xczc
qwee
qefw
4

4 does not occur in the matrix
5.	Square with Maximum Sum
Write a program that reads a matrix from the console. On first line you will get matrix sizes in
format "{rows}, {columns}".  On the next rows, you will get elements for each column separated with
a ", ". Find the 2x2 top-left submatrix with biggest sum of its values. Print the matrix and the sum
of its elements as shown in the examples.
Examples
Input	Output
3, 6
7, 1, 3, 3, 2, 1
1, 3, 9, 8, 5, 6
4, 6, 7, 9, 1, 0

row, col = position
print(matrix[row - 1][col - 1], matrix[row - 1][col])
print(matrix[row][col - 1], matrix[row][col])
print(matrix_max_value)

9 8
7 9
33

2, 4
10, 11, 12, 13
14, 15, 16, 17

12 13
16 17
58
Hints
•	Be aware of IndexError
•	If you find more than one max square, print the top-left one
